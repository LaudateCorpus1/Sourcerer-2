This folder hosts the build file (build.xml) and some of the shell scripts
to run the various tools produced by executing the corresponding targets
in the build.

There are two ways of generating Java executables, through eclipse or through
the command line. The exception is the Jar for the Java program responsible for
extracting information from projects into an intermediate repository used to
import information into a database. This must be build in Eclipse.

The script 'build-add.sh' can be used to quickly build everything
(again, except the extractor that must be built using Eclipse) in UNIX and in Windows.

A detailed tutorial can be found in http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu, which is a mirror
of the website present in the folder /website, in the root of this repository.

A jar file for the Extractor can also be download from http://sourcerer.ics.uci.edu,
or found on /website, in case the user does not want to use Eclipse just to build this.
