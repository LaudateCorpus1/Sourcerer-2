        <h1>The raw dataset</h1>
          This dataset, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011</strong>, takes 368Gb compressed or 433Gb uncompressed, and is a collection of 74,351 Java projects and assorted jar files collected from Google Code, SourceForge and Apache as of Summer 2011. It is also integrated in an infrastructure being built by the DARPA MUSE program, which will hopefully be available for other researchers sometime in the future.

        <h1>The extracted dataset</h1>
          This extracted repository, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_extracted</strong>, takes 84Gb compressed or 92Gb uncompressed, and is an
          intermediary artifact produced from the raw dataset <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011</strong>, which contains facts (fully qualified names, metrics, etc.) about each file of each project.
          We also provide a server serving this data. Please refer to <strong>Database</strong> to know more.

        <h1>The relational database</h1>
          This database, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_database</strong>, takes 24Gb as a compressed MySQL dump or 448Gb when restored, and is an artifact built from the extracted facts (<strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_extracted</strong>). This database contains the output of parsing and decomposing the source code into code entities and their relations, and it is provided to facilitate static analysis.
