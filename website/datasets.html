<h3>Welcome to the UCI Sourcerer Datasets</h3>

<p>
This page is a repository of various datasets
we have collected and curated in our research in large scale analysis of source code. 
These datasets are available for other researchers and individuals to
use. Please refer to the terms of usage that come with each dataset
for any restrictions in usage. Download instructions are provided in each dataset page.

</p>
<p>
Currently available datasets:
</p>

<ul>
<li> 
 [08-04-2015] <b>Sourcerer Repo 2011</b> 
 is a collection of artifacts based on over 70,000 Java projects and almost 100,000 jars collected
 from Apache, Google Code and Sourceforge in 2011. Besides the raw source code and jars, we also
 provide a repository of static analysis facts extracted from the code/jars and a relational DB with
 all that information imported for querying.
