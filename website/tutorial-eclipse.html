        <div class="content_item">

        <p>This tutorial is designed to show how to download, compile, install, and use the Sourcerer infrastructure to build a database of Open Source Software. It is designed to be run using Eclipse. The requirements for this tutorial are:</p>

          <ul>
          	<li>Oracle's Java SE Development Kit 8, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">here</a> (it should work with alternatives, such as <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/" target="_blank">OpenJDK</a>).</li>
            <li>Apache Ant, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Eclipse Luna, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/luna/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>A Mysql server, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Extractor</strong> Jar executable - this file can only be generated by folowing the <strong>Eclipse Tutorial</strong>. If you do not want to do that, you can download it <a href="downloads/Extractor_1.0.0.jar" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>A test repository, <a href="downloads/test-repo.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Start by clonning the Sourcerer repository:</p>
          <p class="command-line-block" > [sourcerer-path]$ git clone https://github.com/Mondego/Sourcerer.git </p>
          <p> where <strong class="command-line-text">[sourcerer-path]</strong> is the directory where you cloned Sourcerer.</p>

		  <h1>Preparing your Environment</h1>

          <p>Start by installing the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) for Eclipse (<a href="https://eclipse.org/pde/" target="_blank">here</a>). The simplest way to do this is to, inside Eclipse, go to <strong>Help &rarr; Eclipse Marketplace</strong> and search for <strong>"pde"</strong>.</p>

          <p>Next, inside Eclipse, go to <strong>File &rarr; Import &rarr; General &rarr; Existing Projects into Workspace</strong>. Press <strong>Next</strong> and under <strong>Select root directory</strong> (first option) browse to <strong class="command-line-text">[sourcerer-path]</strong>. A group of projects should appear. Make sure they are all selected, and press <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>

          <p>Wait a few seconds for Eclipse to build the workspace, and then you should see a list of projects (if you do not see anything, go to <strong>Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Project Explorer</strong>).</p>

          <p class="warning">Do not worry, for now, with possible problems Eclipse allert you about when importing the projects. We will fix them later.</p> 

          <p>You will need to create three folders in your computer, as seen below:</p>
          <p class="command-line-block" > ~$ mkdir crawled-projects </br> ~$ mkdir extracted-projects </br> ~$ mkdir db-import-output </p>
          <p>We created these folders in the home directory. This means, for example, that the folder <strong>crawled-projects</strong> is accessed by typing <strong class="cd command-line-text">cd ~/crawled-projects/</strong>. We will follow this path, but there is no restriction where you create these folders, just be sure to adjust this tutorial accordingly.</p>
          <p>The folder <strong class="cd command-line-text">~/crawled-projects/</strong> should contain Java projects. To start, you can download our test repository (above) and move the contents to this folder.</p>
          <p> Follow the instructions <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> to set-up mysql and create a database. Create a user for the database and give it writing permissions. Save the <strong>DATABASE-URL</strong> (for ex.: localhost if the server is running in your machine), <strong>DATABASE-NAME</strong>, the <strong>DATABASE-USER</strong> and <strong>DATABASE-PASSWORD</strong>.</p>

          <h1>Building your Environment</h1>

          <p>From all the projects you can see in Eclipse, the most important is <strong>bin</strong>. In this project, inside the only existing folder, <strong>launch</strong>, you have the projects split in four groups. Open the folders so that your environment looks exactly like this figure:</p>

          <span class="center"><img src="images/eclipse.png" alt="example graphic" /></span>

          <p>The launch files under <strong>database</strong> and <strong>extractor</strong> are the only ones you need to build. This is easily done by <strong>Right Click on *.launch &rarr; Run As &rarr; [launcher-name]</strong>. For the <strong>extractor</strong>, you will need to run them in the order they appear.</p>

          <p>You can track the process with the <strong>Console</strong> window on Eclipse (<strong> Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Console</strong>).</p>

          <p>Now, go to the <strong>extractor</strong> project, and <strong>Right Click &rarr; Refresh</strong>. The path errors this project had should now disappear.</p>

          <p class="warning">Sometimes running a process on Eclipse that uses PDE is tricky, because even though the process has not finished yet, Eclipse might tell you so. This is a non-solved bug (check <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=58413/" target="_blank">here</a>). If, for example, you are trying to run <strong>Step 3</strong> but you can not, it might be because <strong>Step 2</strong> has not finished yet, even though Eclipse is telling you so. Just wait a few seconds after each step and everything should run smoothly.</p>

          <h2>Want to know more?</h2>
          <p>Under the project <strong>bin</strong> you find <strong>launch</strong> files to build all the tools in the Sourcerer infrastructure. They are as easy to build as the ones we just showed. Give it a try!</p>
