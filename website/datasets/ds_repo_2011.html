        <h1>Sourcerer Repo 2011</h1>
        <div class="content_item">
          <p>We provide 3 data artifacts obtained from running the Sourcerer infrastructure on a collection of 70,000+
          Java projects from Apache. Google Code and Sourceforge. The artifacts are very large files, 
          and can be downloaded by anyone with enough disk space. 
          They are available via <a href="https://www.getsync.com/" target="_blank">BTSync</a> folders, for which hash keys are provided.</p>
          
          <p>The artifacts represent the same information in different formats, after different phases of processing. 
          Under <strong>Tutorials</strong> you can learn how to replicate these artifacts with your own dataset.</p>

          <div class="warning">
            <p>TERMS OF USAGE</p>
            By downloading and using the Sourcerer Repo 2011 artifacts, you agree to abide by the following terms of usage:
            <ul>
              <li>The source code contained in these datasets was collected from various open source projects and you should adhere to the respective licenses that come with the projects.</li>
              <li>You will use the file strictly for non-commercial and non-profit work (eg; research or personal use). Any commercial use of this file is prohibited.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Raw Repository</h2>
          <p>
          This artifacts, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011</strong>, takes 368Gb compressed or 433Gb uncompressed, and is a collection of 74,351 Java projects and assorted jar files collected from Google Code, SourceForge and Apache as of Summer 2011. It is also integrated in an infrastructure being built by the DARPA MUSE program, which will hopefully be available for other researchers sometime in the future.
          </p>

        <h2>The Extracted Facts Repository</h2>
          <p>
          This extracted repository, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_extracted</strong>, takes 84Gb compressed or 92Gb uncompressed, and is an
          intermediary artifact produced from the raw dataset <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011</strong>, which contains facts (fully qualified names, metrics, etc.) about each file of each project.
          </p>

        <h2>The Relational Database</h2>
          <p>
          This database, called <strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_database</strong>, takes 24Gb as a compressed MySQL dump or 448Gb when restored, and is an artifact built from the extracted facts (<strong>sourcerer_repo_2011_extracted</strong>). This database contains the output of parsing and decomposing the source code into code entities and their relations, and it is provided to facilitate static analysis. For more information about this database please check the tab <strong>Database</strong>.
