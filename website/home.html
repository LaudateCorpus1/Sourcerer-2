        <div class="content_item">
          <p><strong>Sourcerer</strong> is an ongoing research project at the <strong>University of California - Irvine</strong> aimed at exploring the open source phenomenon through the use of code analysis. The open source movement has generated an extremely large body of code, which presents a tremendous opportunity to software engineering researchers. Not only do we leverage this code for our own research, but we provide the open source <strong>Sourcerer</strong> Infrastructure for other researchers to use.
